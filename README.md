Source code for my personal website + portfolio (though the "portfolio" part of it is still pending).

Runs on [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) and styled with [Tailwind](https://github.com/tailwindcss/tailwindcss).

## üöÄ Launching this thing

**Note:** if you haven't already, install the Gatsby CLI tool globally before proceeding: `npm install -g gatsby-cli` (or `yarn global add gatsby-cli`)

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/ohheyjosh/portfolio.git`
2. Enter the source folder: `cd portfolio`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install` (or `yarn add`)
4. Launch into development mode: `gatsby develop`
5. When you're ready to deploy, compile a production version with `gatsby build` or deploy via a JAMstack host like [Render](https://render.com), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), or [Now](https://zeit.co).
